# Final-Project

## questions:
## Which county has the most bike crashes? (KEVIN)
## Which county has the highest fatality:crash ratio? (ROHAN) 
## Which type of road leads to the most injuries, what about fatalities? (RYAN)
## What is the mean fatality rate? among types of streets (ROHAN)
## Make an injury map (KEVIN)
## Which county has highest bike crash per CAP? (RYAN)
## Which county has highest fatalities per CAP?  (RYAN)
## Is there a correlation between population size and fatalities? (ROHAN)   

Notes: -dot size for each county per total (Density), an app for a map by injury types and highway type.

-Check how many counties actually have bike crashes

Create a categorical variable for size of county (small, med large) and see how crashes relate to population size.
